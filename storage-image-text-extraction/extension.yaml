      Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?
      You usually want a location close to your database. Realtime Database
      instances are located in `us-central1`. For help selecting a
      location, refer to the [location selection
      guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

    label: Cloud Storage bucket for images
    description: >
      To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images from which you want to extract text?
    type: string
    example: my-project-12345.appspot.com

      What is the path to the collection where extracted text will be written to.
    example: extractedText
    validationRegex: "^[^/]+(/[^/]+/[^/]+)*$"
    validationErrorMessage: Must be a valid Cloud Firestore Collection
    default: extractedText
    required: true
  - param: INCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: Paths that contain images you want to extract text from
    description: >
      Restrict storage-image-text-extraction to only extract text from images in specific locations in your Storage bucket by 
      supplying a comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, specifying the paths `/users/pictures,/restaurants/menuItems`
      will process any images found in any subdirectories of `/users/pictures` and `/restaurants/menuItems`.
      
      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For example, `/users/*/pictures`
      would exclude any images in any subdirectories of `/users/foo/pictures` as well as any images in
      subdirectories of `/users/bar/pictures`, but also any images in subdirectories of `/users/any/level/of/subdirectories/pictures`. 
      
      If you prefer not to explicitly exclude any directories of your Storage bucket, leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars,/design/pictures"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: EXCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: List of absolute paths not included for image text extraction
    description: >
      Ensure storage-image-text-extraction does *not* process images in _specific locations_ in your Storage bucket by 
      supplying a comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, to *exclude* the images 
      stored in the `/foo/alpha` and its subdirectories and `/bar/beta` and its subdirectories, specify the
      paths `/foo/alpha,/bar/beta`.
      
      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For example, `/users/*/pictures` would
      exclude any images in any subdirectories of `/users/foo/pictures` as well as any images in subdirectories of
      `/users/bar/pictures`, but also any images in subdirectories of `/users/any/level/of/subdirectories/pictures`.
      
      If you prefer to process every image uploaded to your Storage bucket, 
      leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars/thumbs,/design/pictures/thumbs"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
