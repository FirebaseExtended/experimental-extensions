      Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?
      You usually want a location close to your database. Realtime Database
      instances are located in `us-central1`. For help selecting a
      location, refer to the [location selection
      guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Iowa (us-central1)
        value: us-central1
      - label: South Carolina (us-east1)
        value: us-east1
      - label: Northern Virginia (us-east4)

  - param: IMG_BUCKET
    label: Cloud Storage bucket for images
    description: >
      To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images on which you want to perform labelling?
    type: string
    example: my-project-12345.appspot.com
    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid storage bucket
    default: ${STORAGE_BUCKET}
    required: true
  
  - param: INCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: Paths that contain images you want to label
    description: >
      Restrict storage-image-labeling to only label images in specific locations in your Storage bucket by 
      supplying a comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, specifying the paths `/users/pictures,/restaurants/menuItems`
      will label any images found in any subdirectories of `/users/pictures` and `/restaurants/menuItems`.
      
      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For example, `/users/*/pictures`
      would exclude any images in any subdirectories of `/users/foo/pictures` as well as any images in
      subdirectories of `/users/bar/pictures`, but also any images in subdirectories of `/users/any/level/of/subdirectories/pictures`. 
      
      If you prefer not to explicitly exclude any directories of your Storage bucket, leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars,/design/pictures"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: EXCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: List of absolute paths not included for labelled images
    description: >
      Ensure storage-image-labeling does *not* label images in _specific locations_ in your Storage bucket by 
      supplying a comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, to *exclude* the images 
      stored in the `/foo/alpha` and its subdirectories and `/bar/beta` and its subdirectories, specify the
      paths `/foo/alpha,/bar/beta`.
      
      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For example, `/users/*/pictures` would
      exclude any images in any subdirectories of `/users/foo/pictures` as well as any images in subdirectories of
      `/users/bar/pictures`, but also any images in subdirectories of `/users/any/level/of/subdirectories/pictures`.
      
      If you prefer to label every image uploaded to your Storage bucket, 
      leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars/thumbs,/design/pictures/thumbs"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: COLLECTION_PATH
    label: Collection path
    description: >
      What is the path to the collection where labels will be written to?
    example: imageLabels
    validationRegex: "^[^/]+(/[^/]+/[^/]+)*$"
    validationErrorMessage: Must be a valid Cloud Firestore Collection
    default: imageLabels
    required: true

  - param: LABEL_MODE
    label: Amount of label information to write to firestore.
    description: >
      How much label information should be written to firestore? Do you want just the label descriptions written to firestore, 
      or the full label annotation? Select \"basic\" for the former, \"full\" for the later.
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Basic
        value: basic
      - label: Full
        value: full
    default: basic
